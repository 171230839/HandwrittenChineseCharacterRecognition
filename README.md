# Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition

A simple CNN with 4 convolutional layers and 2 fully-connected layers with dropout. Accuracy on test set is 93%. Actually you can acquire a better accuracy by adding couple layers and training more steps. In pratice, I trained 100k step on GTX1080, it take 10 hours and turns out that the accuracy is still gradually increasing, so I guess no overfitting issue out there.

Environment: Python 3.5+Tensorflow nightly build

This project is final project of Computer Vision class.
